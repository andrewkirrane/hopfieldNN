# Hopfield Neural Net

This project was a java based implementation of a simple neural net following the Hopfield design. This net was created as an image classifier and was able to correctly identify broken and noise filled versions of low quality image patterns based on completed versions that it was trained on. Although this version is only capable of recognizing small image patterns, it is a great look into the vast capabilities of this type of neural net.
